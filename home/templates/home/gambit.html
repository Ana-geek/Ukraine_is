<p class="text"> The Queen's Gambit is a fictional story that follows the life of an orphan chess prodigy, Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy), during her quest to become the world's greatest chess player while struggling with emotional issues and drug and alcohol dependency. The story begins in the mid-1950s and proceeds into the 1960s.</p>

<p class="text">The series starts in a girl's orphanage where Beth meets Jolene (Moses Ingram), a vibrant and friendly girl a few years older than Beth; Helen Deardorff (Christiane Seidel), the woman running the orphanage; and Mr. Shaibel (Bill Camp), the custodian of the orphanage who teaches Beth her first chess lessons. As was common during the 1950s,[4] the orphanage dispenses daily tranquilizer pills to the girls which turns into an addiction for Beth. A few years later, Beth is adopted by Alma Wheatley (Marielle Heller) and her husband from Lexington, Kentucky. After being adopted and in her new home, Beth enrolls herself in chess tournaments even though she has no prior experience in tournaments. She wins many games and finally gets noticed by others and develops friendships with several people, including Harry Beltik (Harry Melling), Benny Watts (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and Townes (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd). Along the way, as Beth continues to win games and becomes more famous, she becomes more dependent on drugs and alcohol, and starts to lose control of her life.</p>
